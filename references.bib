    abstract = { Traditional translations of 1 Corinthians 7.1 suggest to the reader that the words “It is good for a man not to touch a woman” (KJV) are Paul’s words of advice to the Corinthians. Many recent translations, however, correctly indicate that Paul is here quoting words from a letter written to him from the Corinthians. The Greek words peri de (“now concerning”) here and in 8.1; 12.1; 16.1, and 16.12 introduce a new topic that has been raised in a letter from Corinth. The words translated “to touch” are a euphemism for “to have sexual relations.” The following translation in REB is recommended as a model for other languages: “Now for the matters you wrote about. You say, ‘It is a good thing for a man not to have intercourse with a woman.’” }

    abstract = { When Martin Luther mounted an attack on the industry of Indulgences, he affirmed key Reformation principles: human beings are saved by God’s grace alone and the priesthood of all the baptised gives all followers of Christ equal status. This was in conformity with an earlier generation of reformers who saw the Bible as ultimate authority and witnessed to biblical truth against corruption. The logical consequence of this should have been the enabling of women who were so disposed to exercise a theological vocation. In practice, the resulting rupture in religious and social life often affected women for the worse. Educational formation and leadership opportunities were restricted by the closure of convents. While the trade guilds, with their tightly regulated social systems, did not allow scope for women who transgressed normative expectations, their suppression was not necessarily liberating for women. The new social model of the home replaced that of convent and guild and marriage was exalted in place of celibacy. Changes in devotional practice involved loss and gain. Women who did not conform to the domestic norm were treated at best with misogyny and female prophets of the radical Reformation paid for their convictions with their lives. In education, leadership, piety and radical social challenge, women’s options were restricted. However, the key Reformation principles ultimately enabled the development of women’s ministry which was marked by the ordination of Constance Todd 400 years later. }
